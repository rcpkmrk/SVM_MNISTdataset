# **Support Vector Machines (SVM) Multi-Classification on the MNIST Dataset**

This project explores the use of Support Vector Machines for multi-class classification on the famous MNIST dataset, a benchmark dataset for handwritten digit recognition.

## **Key Features**
- **Dimensionality Reduction**  
  Applied feature extraction techniques to reduce dimensionality, aiming to minimize training time while preserving essential data characteristics.

- **Hyperparameter Optimization**  
  Conducted an in-depth analysis and tuning of SVM hyperparameters (e.g., `C`, `gamma`, `kernel`) to enhance model accuracy and performance.
